<h3>Why a Mentoring Program at IEEE Cluster 2017?</h3>

The Mentoring Program at IEEE Cluster 2017 is a program for PhD, Master, and
Undergraduate students that wants to help students building their scientific
career as efficiently as possible. The scientific presentations and
interactions with conference attendees help them develop their technical
skills. The Student Mentoring Program complements and extends this development
by fostering the integration of the students into the Cluster scientific
community, advising them to plan their professional career in academia or
industry, improving their scientific communication skills, and providing them
with the right entry points for an efficient networking.

Students enrolled full time in a graduate or undergraduate program in USA
institutions, if selected for this student program, are eligible for travel
awards from the National Science Foundation.

<h2>Applying to the Mentoring Program</h2>

The Student Mentoring Program is not just another publication venue. All interested
students can apply through a simple, non-competitive process, by providing a short
description of why they want to participate in the conference, the name of their
advisor, and their CV. The student’s adviser should endorse the student’s application
and will be contacted once the application is submitted.

Please submit your application via the <a
href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeecluster2017">EasyChair
submission system</a>.

<h2>Important Dates</h2>

Applications will be reviewed <b>starting June 30, 2017</b>.

Travel awards for students in USA institutions in the amount of up to <b>$1,000</b>
will be assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis until completion of the
available funding.
