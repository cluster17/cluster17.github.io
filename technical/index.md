IEEE Cluster 2017 is the 19th edition of the IEEE Cluster conference series.<br>

Clusters are the primary architecture for building today's rapidly evolving
cloud and HPC infrastructures, and are used to solve some of the most complex
problems.  The challenge to make them scalable, efficient, and more functional
requires a community effort in the areas of cluster system design, management
and monitoring, at the hardware, system, middleware and application levels.<br>

Following the successes of previous <a href="http://www.clustercomp.org">IEEE
Cluster conferences</a>, for IEEE Cluster 2017, which will be held September
05-08, 2016 in Hawaii USA, we again solicit high-quality original work that
advances the state-of-the-art in clusters and closely related fields.  All
papers will be rigorously peer-reviewed for their originality, technical depth
and correctness, potential impact, relevance to the conference, and quality of
presentation. Research papers must clearly demonstrate novel research
contributions while papers reporting experiences must clearly describe lessons
learned and impact, along with the utility of the approach compared to previous
ones.<br>

Authors must indicate the primary area of preference out of the four areas
below. They may optionally rank the other areas. The paper may be accepted as a
full paper, or the committee might decide to accept it as a short paper in the
proceedings.<br>

<h3>Area 1: Application, Algorithms, and Libraries</h3>
